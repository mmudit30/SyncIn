Music Player using Emotion Recognition

This is a project based on the concept of Computer Vision and Emotion detection. In this project, I have used computer vision to detect the emotion a person is exhibiting. Through the emotion detected, the system shall identify a song playlist according to the mood of the user.
It will provide an easy access to any song the user wants to listen according to his/her mood thus decreasing the work of switching to apps for the particular songs. 
The project is based on the technology of Computer Vision and specifically on the subfield of Emotion detection. 
This technology is used in coordination with the generation of desired music based on the mood detected. This project diminishes the need for switching in between various music apps. 

As the technology is advance every second, humans, nowadays tend to be drawn towards smart work rather than hard work. And nowadays, music has become an essential part of every individual's life. So, incorporated these two prevailing factors and created this project.
